## RESTful soil sensor
A quick MicroPython script to make capacative soil sensor data available
via a REST API for use with Home Assistant.

The soil sensor used was [this one from The Pi Hut in the UK](https://thepihut.com/products/capacitive-soil-moisture-sensor), but similar sensors are available from anywhere.
